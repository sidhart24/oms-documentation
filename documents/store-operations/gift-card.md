# Gift Card Activation

HotWax Commerceâ€™s `Fulfillment App` enables store associates to `activate gift cards` directly during the `order fulfillment process`. The Direct Activation feature allows `gift cards` to be activated in real-time as part of order fulfillment, while Automated Synchronization with Shopify ensures that activation codes are instantly updated, making gift cards redeemable without delays. This process minimizes potential errors and provides a faster experience for both fulfillment teams and customers.

## Steps to Activate Gift Cards from the Fulfillment App:
1. **Access the Fulfillment App**: `Open` the HotWax Commerce `Fulfillment App` and navigate to the `In Progress` section.
2. **Find the Gift Card Order**: `Locate` the order containing the `gift card`, easily identifiable by a `gift box icon` near the `bin` and `cubical icons`.
3. **Click the Gift Box Icon**: Select the `gift box icon` to view the specific gift card details and its associated `code`.
4. **Add the Gift Card Number**: Enter the `gift card number` on the `activation page`.
5. **Click the Save Icon**: After entering the number, click the `save icon` to complete the activation, ensuring the `gift card` is immediately usable by the customer.
