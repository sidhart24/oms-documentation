# Packed Order Tab

All orders that are packed and ready to be handed over to customers are displayed on the `Packed` tab on Orders page. Users can also use the `Search` bar on this page to find packed orders using customer name, product name, or order ID. Some key attributes on the order cards available on this page are listed below.

* **Generate Packing Slip:** A packing slip is a document listing the contents of a package. It serves as a quick reference for both the sender and the recipient to verify products in the package. With the generate packing slip feature, store associates can generate packing slips manually using the `print` icon, available on each order card.

{% hint style="info" %}
For packing slip (document) generation, the app opens a new tab. Ensure that the pop-up blocker is disabled to allow seamless access.
{% endhint %}

* **Email:** In case a customer doesn’t come to pick up their order, users can re-send ready for pickup email notification to the customer using the `mail` icon available on the order card, a pop-up card will appear confirming re-sending the email. This feature addresses the challenge of delayed pick-ups, misunderstandings, and even order cancellations. This action can also be performed from the `Order details` page.
* **Handover:** When customers arrive to receive their orders and the store associates handover the order to the customer, they need to click on the `Handover` button to mark the order as delivered. Alternatively, this can also be done on the `Order details` page of the packed order.

Stock information, order timeline, and handling instructions are also visible on the order card on this page.

{% hint style="info" %}
After clicking the \`Handover\` button, the orders are marked completed and moved to \`Completed\` tab.
{% endhint %}

## BOPIS Picklist

Store associates can print picklists for `BOPIS` (Buy Online, Pick Up In Store) orders through HotWax Commerce’s `BOPIS App`, streamlining the review of handling instructions and ensuring accurate `picking` and `packing` of items. This feature allows associates to fulfill pickup orders while clearly noting any special requests, such as gift wrapping or specific packaging requirements.

For example, if a customer requests gift wrapping, the printed picklist will prominently display this instruction, enabling the associate to prepare the item accordingly before notifying the customer that their order is ready for `pickup`. This not only boosts accuracy in `order` `fulfillment` but also enhances the overall customer experience by ensuring all special instructions are seamlessly followed.

## Steps to Print Picklists in the BOPIS App:

1. **Access the BOPIS App**: Open the HotWax Commerce BOPIS App on your device.
2. **Navigate to the Order Details Page**: Go to the `Order Details` section to `view` all current `BOPIS` orders.
3. **Select the Relevant Order**: `Locate` the specific order you need to fulfill.
4. **Find the Print Icon**: Within the order box, you will see a `print icon`. Click on this icon to initiate the `printing process`.
5. **Print the Picklist**: The app will generate a detailed `picklist` that includes all necessary information, including handling instructions and any special requests from the customer.
